# First Impressions of VuePress and what I want to learn

I chose to write this blog in VuePress for three reasons.

1. I already use Vue.js at work
2. I wanted to learn how to use a static site generator
3. It seemed to be a good option at the time


## Simplicity
I am stunned by how simple it is to get a website up and running. You can write perfectly formatted content quickly and easily.

## Styling Concerns
I am not a huge fan of the default theme. However I look forward into learning how to style it with. https://vuepressbook.com/style-overriding-default.html . 

## Integration with Vue
So far simple text and routing is nice. I wonder how easy it is and what functionality comes with Vue.
